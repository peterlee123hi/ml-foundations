    "\n",
    "Before attention, raw text is turned into vectors through **tokenization** and **embedding**. Tokenization splits a sentence into smaller units. In practice, this is usually **subword pieces** (e.g. \"Transformers\" $\\rightarrow$ [\"Trans\", \"former\", \"s\"]), each mapped to an integer ID from the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each ID is then mapped to a **word embedding**, a vector of size $d_{model}$ (often 128â€“1024+). A **positional encoding** is often added to represent where each token appears in the sequence. After this step, a sequence of length $n$ is represented as a matrix of shape $(n, d_{model})$ where each row is a token.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this input matrix, the model forms three projections, queries $Q$, keys $K$, and values $V$. Each is obtained by multiplying the input matrix by a different weight matrix ($W_Q$, $W_K$, $W_V$). Intuitively, each token produces a query that asks what it wants, a key that signals what it offers, and a value that carries the content to be shared. These are the inputs to the attention mechanism.\n"

    "- **Causal mask:** prevents a token from looking ahead at future tokens, which is required in the decoder for autoregressive generation.\n",
